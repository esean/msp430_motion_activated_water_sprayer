msp430_motion_activated_water_sprayer
=====================================

Uses PIR (passive infrared) sensors and a PIC microprocessor to detect when someone is near. Then tries it's best to surprise them by suddenly turning on a water sprayer. Intent is the timing is random and not predictable.

Future intent was to add a microphone so the uP could hear the children's shrieks, and try to better adapt it's timing to maximize that sound amplitude.
